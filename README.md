# Github Contribution Grid in Flutter as a Widget

Project for fun rather than an actual widget.

## Getting Started

The project might not be ready so far, but this README file will be updated according to the level of this widget

### at the moment :
the widget can take a List of Lists asd input and those also share data as Maps (Dictionaries).

the widget will display the data in a row of pillars each pillar is a combination of 7 small boxes stacked on top of each other.

the box itself is dynamically set to have a system of colors based on the percentage calculation, in my example it's going to be a calculation of the input data that got a max value of 10 for each box which will make the box full of color.
